# Filament-approximation
This formula approximates the length and mass of filament on your spool. 
The formula sums the the circumference of each layer and multplies it with the rows of each layer. All input units should be in mm an the output value is in meters, gram. 
I first uploaded this to reddit, where you can see the formula written mathematicaly.

Plese note there was a small mistake in the previous version, which occured when using the function multiple times. I fixed the issue in the current version.
