# Filament-approximation
This formula approximates the lengh of filament on your spool. 
The formula sums the the circumference of each layer and multplies it with the rows of each layer. All input units should be in mm an the output value is in meters. 
I first uploaded this to reddit there you can see the formula written mathematicaly.

Plese note there was a small mistake in the previus version, wich occured when using the function multiple times. I fixed the issue in the current version.
